## BASE

The base or print bed is the flat surface on which the object is built during the 3D printing process. It is usually a heated platform that provides stability and adhesion for the initial layers of the print.

## EXTRUDER

The extruder is a fundamental component of a 3D printer. It is responsible for depositing and shaping the molten thermoplastic filament used to build the object layer by layer.
## MATERIAL SPOOL

Material spool is the cylindrical holder or container that holds the filament used for printing. The filament, which is typically in the form of a long, thin thread, is wound around the spool.
## FILAMENT

Filament is a long, thin strand of thermoplastic material that is fed into the 3D printer's extruder, melted, and deposited layer by layer to create a three-dimensional object.PLA (Polylactic Acid),ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene),PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) are some of the commonly used filament materials.

Prepare the 3D Model: Begin by creating or obtaining a 3D model of the object you want to print. This can be done using computer-aided design (CAD) software or by downloading pre-designed models from online repositories.
Slicing the Model: Use slicing software to convert the 3D model into a format that the 3D printer can understand. Slicing software divides the model into thin horizontal layers and generates the corresponding toolpath instructions for the printer.
Set Up the 3D Printer: Ensure that your 3D printer is properly set up and calibrated. This involves tasks such as checking the bed leveling, verifying the nozzle height, and confirming the proper functioning of the printer's components.
Prepare the Print Surface: Clean the print bed to remove any dust or debris. Depending on the printer and filament, you may need to apply adhesive, such as glue stick or hairspray, or use a specialized print surface like a heated bed or a removable magnetic base.
Load Filament: Insert the filament spool into the 3D printer's filament holder and feed the filament through the filament path, guiding it into the extruder. Ensure that the filament is properly aligned with the feeder mechanism.
Heat the Extruder: Set the desired temperature for the extruder based on the recommended temperature for the filament material you are using. The printer's control panel or software interface will allow you to adjust the extruder temperature.
Preheat and Prime the Nozzle: Start the preheating process to bring the extruder to the desired temperature. Once the extruder reaches the target temperature, extrude a small amount of filament to ensure that it is flowing smoothly and there are no clogs.
Start Printing: Load the sliced file (generated in step 2) onto the 3D printer, either via USB, SD card, or through a network connection. Select the desired print settings, such as layer height, print speed, and infill density, and start the printing process.
Monitor the Print: During the printing process, keep an eye on the progress to ensure that everything is proceeding as expected. Make sure the filament is feeding properly, the layers are adhering to the print bed, and there are no issues like filament jams or warping.
Post-Processing: Once the print is complete, allow the object to cool down before removing it from the print bed. Depending on the filament and desired finish, you may need to perform additional post-processing steps, such as removing support structures, sanding, painting, or other surface treatments.
## STOP PROCESS

Pause the Print: If you need to temporarily stop the printing process, most 3D printers have a pause function. Use the printer's control panel or software interface to pause the print. This will halt the extrusion of filament and movement of the print head.
Address the Issue: If you stopped the print due to an issue or error, such as a filament jam or warping, take the necessary steps to resolve the problem. Clear any obstructions, adjust settings, or address any other issues that may have caused the pause.
Resume or Cancel the Print: Once the issue has been resolved, you can choose to either resume the print or cancel it.
Resume: If you paused the print temporarily, you can resume it from where it left off. Use the printer's control panel or software interface to resume the print, and the extruder will continue from the previous layer.
Cancel: If you decide to cancel the print, use the printer's control panel or software interface to stop the print entirely. This will halt the printing process, and the print bed and extruder will cool down.
Power Down the Printer: Once the print has been canceled or completed, it's good practice to power down the 3D printer. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for properly shutting down the printer.
Clean Up: Clean the print bed and remove any remaining filament from the extruder, especially if you don't plan to start another print immediately. Store the filament properly, either by returning it to the spool or using filament storage containers to protect it from moisture and dust.
